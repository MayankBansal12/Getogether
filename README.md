## Prototype vision
We are looking to build a platform that will cater to the needs of event planning and organizing. At first, we will be looking to focus on hosts or event organisers’ perspective and will be looking to integrate basic features allowing them to keep a check on participants, dividing the whole event into small sub-events and making it easier for them to organize, ensure communication with guests and vendors and maintain payment history. 
Later we can add more features to cater for vendors and make it useful for them beyond communication and focusing more towards their services and payments.
We will be looking to create an end to end platform involving all three main parties- hosts, vendors and guests, and provide something for each of them that will make their event experiences better. 
The event planning won’t be limited to just weddings or birthdays, our vision would be to build a generic platform allowing users to manage any event involving big meetups or recites. Once the foundation is built, we can expand by adding more features specific to the event type(different features for different event types like managing vendors and catering services in weddings, managing speakers sessions and fun activities in case of meetups).
